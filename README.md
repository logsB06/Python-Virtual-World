#Python Virtual World
WARNING! This program requires IDLE, which you can get at https://python.org/downloads/windows if you are on a windows computer. Make sure to download at least version 3.

This program allows you to build your own world by creating blocks and circles, saving your work, resetting your work and moving the black circle (you).

On the URL, just add "Version_1/home.py", and you are good to go!
